## Project Log

### Entry A: Speed Run to Completion

Another keyboard finished—my third one, and all in a single day! (Of course, that’s not counting the ~80 hours spent on my first build, but experience pays off.) By reusing parts and knowledge, I managed to complete the schematic, PCB, CAD, and item research for under $150.

This project was a non-stop sprint, but I’m genuinely proud of the result. GameBoard V2 is something I’ll be happy to keep and use for years to come.

You’ll find images below, and the Bill of Materials (BOM) is available in this repository. Everything you need for this build is included here.

Thanks for following along! I’ll post updates once all the components arrive.
